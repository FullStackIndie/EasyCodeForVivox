> [!NOTE]
> This asset may work with IOS, Mac, Linux, or Consoles. Implement at your own discretion. Since the source is included you can modify it.

## Dependencies

This asset is a simple **API** to interact with the **Vivox Unity SDK** which is available in the **Unity Package Manager** as **Vivox** (You may have to enable preview packages or add it manually). This asset is built on top of **Vivox Voice and Text Chat** and will not work without it (You can also download the **SDK** through Vivox’s website, and this asset will still work if that is your preferred method). You must create an account with Vivox at [Login - Vivox Developer][vivox-portal] Portal and agree to Vivox’s Terms or sign up with [Unity Gaming Services][ugs] (Recommended) and accept their Terms of Use before you can use their services. Unity Gaming Services(UGS) may require a credit/debit card to sign up and use their services.

# EasyCodeForVivox
This is an Extension Asset for **Vivox Voice Chat SDK** . This repo will always be more updated than the Unity Asset Store version but...  I also may accidentaly commit and push bugs and breaking changes to this repo when I am just trying to save some work. **EasyCodeForVivox** on the Unity Asset Store will always be the most reliable version. **Downloading from this Github Repo directly at your own risk**.

**There have been many breaking changes since I first started this project, but starting from EasyCode 2.0 I will try and provide backwards compatibilty for future releases and If I deprecate something I will leave in the asset until there is enough documentation on how to upgrade/migrate your code to the newest versions**

Designed for use **Vivox Voice Chat** on the **Unity Asset Store** and Unity Game Engine version **2019.4.28f1** because it has long term support (**Excluding the 3D demo scene, see below**).

This Asset comes with a **3D demo scene** that requires Unity's Networking stack **NetCodeForGameObjects**. If you want to use the 3d demo scene you need **Unity 2021.3.11f** or similar **2021.3 version**.

If you don't need the 3D demo scenes then you wont need to import NetCodeForGameObjects and the scripts should work with any 2019, 2020, or 2021 versions. **You can still use the Chat scene demo** since it doesnt require **NetCodeForGameObjects**.

**You can try 2018 versions at your own risk. Im not sure Vivox supports 2018 anymore**. 

**Vivox Voice Chat** is a seperate asset in the **Unity Asset Store** that must be downloaded seperately. You can also download from **Unity Gaming Services Dashboard** or from the **Vivox Developer Portal**.
